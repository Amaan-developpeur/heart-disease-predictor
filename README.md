# Heart Disease Predictor

A machine learning project to predict the presence of heart disease using clinical and demographic data.

## Overview

This repository implements a predictive model for heart disease based on patient data. It uses classic ML algorithms to classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease or not.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature scaling  
- Model training with Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV  
- Performance evaluation with accuracy metrics

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amaan-developpeur/heart-disease-predictor.git
   cd heart-disease-predictor


## Dataset

The file `heart.csv` contains the dataset used for training and testing. It is included in this repository.

Ensure `heart.csv` is in the project root directory before running the notebook or script.
